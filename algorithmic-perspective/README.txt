Machine Learning

Algorithm 1: The Perceptron

The perceptron is the simplest, most basic ML algorithm.
It makes use of the concept of 'neurons' which have 2 operations:
to fire or to not fire. 
The use of a lot of neurons for a given input thus implies that
 almost any function could be generated by the firing 
(and not firing of these neurons). 
The firing of a neuron is decided by the 'threshold'. Neurons are
depicted as weights (Wij), and the input as X.
Thus, our machine learning algorithm has to come up with the values 
of Wij such that for the given input X, we get an output vector which 
resembles the target vector as much as possible.

For the Perceptron:

if Wij *Xi > 0: we output 1 
otherwise 0

Note: The perceptron is a very simplistic algorithm, and should not be
used for actual deployment!
